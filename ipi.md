title: "Evidence-based recommendations for intepregnancy intervals and family planning"
---

Interpregnancy interval (IPI) is the time between birth and start of the next pregnancy with short IPI linked to adverse maternal and child health outcomes.  The current World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations for IPI are heavily driven by studies on low-middle income populations, where women’s recovery time must be considered against a background of nutritional depletion and extraordinary burden of disease. The current WHO recommendations are not relevant in high-income countries, where the changing obstetric profile (increasing maternal age, increasing caesarean section rates and increasing chronic morbidities) is most relevant. Importantly, IPI recommendations must be balanced against an increasing prevalence of women starting a family later in life. For the majority of women, the harms of longer IPIs at advanced maternal age might outweigh the benefits of avoiding adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with shorter IPIs. However, there is a paucity of studies to inform such context specific IPI recommendations. Recent evidence also indicates that current IPI recommendations are possibly not relevant in low-income countries, although this requires substantially more research. Modifying IPI does not require medical intervention, incurs no financial cost and can be adopted at an international scale. Identifying optimal IPI, if any, will provide important information for women and clinicians in planning future pregnancy and informing maternal care and clinical decision-making. This study will identify impacts of IPI on a range of outcomes (preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, autism, childhood development), motivate family planning counselling guidelines in lower income countries and provide new IPI recommendations for high-income countries and lead to public health improvement whether or not IPI is found to be harmful. If harmful, this study will lead to a reduction in avoidable excess morbidities attributable to IPI. If IPI is in fact not harmful, the study will lead to a reduction in age-related morbidities attributable to women delaying subsequent pregnancy according to currently inappropriate WHO guidelines; or may also reassure women, especially in cases of unplanned pregnancy.
