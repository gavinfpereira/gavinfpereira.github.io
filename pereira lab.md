# The lab

Our Epidemiology Research Lab is a hub for innovative population health research, tackling the biological, social and environmental drivers of wellbeing. We use cutting‑edge machine learning AI and causal epidemiological inference to unravel how climate change, vulnerable populations, reproductive health and global determinants shape health outcomes. Our team of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, health economists, clinicians, geneticists and environmental scientists collaborate with world‑class global partners while training the next generation of researchers through our honours, masters and PhD programs. By engaging communities and industry, we translate evidence into action, producing insights that make a real difference.
