title: "Prediction of stillbirth and perinatal morbidity with machine learning"
---

Predicting perinatal mortality and morbidity in early pregnancy remains elusive as clinical management cannot currently make full use of the information provided by the best predictors – family and obstetric history – which could be provided with risk stratification. Stratification of risk is necessary to objectively support clinical decisions for prevention of avoidable perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although single risk factors are aetiologically important, prognosis (prediction) and clinical management require an individualised approach that uses all available risk factors to substantially improve primary prevention. This project involves application of machine learning methods to predict the risk of stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birth weight by analysing more than 4.5 million births in Australia (WA, NSW, SA, NT).

Almost half of stillbirths can be potentially identified antenatally based on a combination of current pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies, maternal characteristics, and medical history. Greatest sensitivity is achieved when current pregnancy complications are used for prediction. Machine learning classifiers (ensemble methods) offer some improvement for prediction compared to the classical method most often applied in medical research (logistic regression).
