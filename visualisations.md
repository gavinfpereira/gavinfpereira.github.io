**Change in global early childhood mortality**

The following figure shows change in global early childhood mortality as a function of the fertility rate. Points represent countries and their size is proportional to their population. The overall trend indicates improvement over time. However, for some countries early childhood mortality deviates from this downward trend due to war, famine, infectious disease and extreme weather events from climate change.

**Interpregnancy interval and risk of autism**

The following figure shows the extent to which associations between interpregnancy intervals (IPI) and autistic spectrum disorder changes after control for socioeconomic, psychiatric and latent (unobserved) confounders. This discovery demonstrates that effects of short IPI have been overstated and the relative importance of the effects of long IPI (possibly via biological aging).
